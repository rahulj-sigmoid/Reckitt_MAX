This trend can indicate a sporadic acquisition strategy or external factors influencing monthly wins.\n\n- **Hospitals Lost**: The number of hospitals lost fluctuates each month, with certain months showing higher losses. This variability might suggest challenges in retention or competition in certain periods.\n\n- **Rolling Net Hospitals Won**: The trend line is moving generally upward from January 2022 to mid-2024, indicating a steady net increase in the number of hospitals won, even as there are fluctuations in monthly gains and losses. This suggests that despite some months with notable hospital losses, the overall trend is one of growth, with more hospitals being won than lost on a rolling basis.\n\nTo strengthen performance, identifying specific months or conditions contributing to high losses could help strategize retention efforts, while months with high wins can provide insights for replicating success in other periods."

The line representing 'Net Hospitals Won (Rolling)' shows an increasing trend until July 2024, peaking at 30 hospitals.\n\n\t2. The net gain in hospital contracts starts to decrease after July, indicating a slowing momentum.\n\n- **Spikes in Hospital Wins**:\n\n\t1. Significant increases in 'Hospitals Won' are observed in February (18) and May (8), contributing to the rise in the rolling net wins.\n\n\t2. However, a noticeable dip in the number of hospitals won is observed in August (2) and September (1).\n\n- **Consistent Growth Early On**:\n\n\t1. From January to May 2024, there is a consistent increase in net hospitals won, reflecting effective acquisition strategies and relatively controlled losses during this period.\n\n- **Need to Address Recent Losses**:\n\n\t1. The increasing hospital losses in September are a red flag. If not addressed, this trend could erode the earlier gains in net hospitals.\n\n- **Caution on Plateauing Growth**:\n\n\t1. While there was strong momentum in the first half of 2024, the plateauing and slight decline in net rolling wins after July signal a need for reinvigorated strategies to sustain growth.\n\n- **Recommendations**:\n\n\t1. Focus on analyzing the causes behind the September spike in hospital losses.\n\n\t2. Reassess strategies in July and August that resulted in fewer hospital acquisitions.\n\n\t3. Continue leveraging the strengths observed in the earlier months of 2024 to regain momentum."

In fact, this relationship is so strong that increases in 'Running Net Births Won' are directly connected to higher sales at the point of sale (POS).\n\n- **Impact on Sales**: For every additional 'birth won' added to the cumulative total, sales are likely to increase by about 957 units. So, if your cumulative net births won goes up by 1,000, you could expect an increase of around 957,000 units in sales.\n\n- **Model Reliability**: The model explaining this relationship is quite solid, as it accounts for 71% of the variation in total sales. This means that 'Running Net Births Won' is one of the most important factors driving POS sales.\n\n- **Actionable Insight**: If you can increase the net number of births won each quarter, you’re likely to see a meaningful boost in sales. Tracking and boosting these net births won is therefore a valuable strategy for increasing sales.\n\nThese findings clarify that running net births won isn't just a metric—it’s closely tied to sales performance, so focusing on it could help drive growth."
